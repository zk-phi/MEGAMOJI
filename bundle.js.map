https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM05/Chap5.html\n*\n* According to the documentation F24DOT6 values are used for pixels.\n* That means calculation is 1/64 pixel accurate and uses integer operations.\n* However, Javascript has floating point operations by default and only\n* those are available. One could make a case to simulate the 1/64 accuracy\n* exactly by truncating after every division operation\n* (for example with << 0) to get pixel exactly results as other TrueType\n* implementations. It may make sense since some fonts are pixel optimized\n* by hand using DELTAP instructions.
